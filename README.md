## Usage
Please change the values of input file Name, page numbers and output file name before running the code. All of these fields are preceded by TODO. It is recommended to have the code in the same folder as the pdf file, but if it is in separate folder please make sure the input file Name also included the file path as well.

```

## Background
I was at home during the lockdown due to coronavirus. During this time, my mother who is a teacher was trying to split/extract a school book into its chapter so that it could be shared with the students. But since the book was more than 100 mb it was not possible to upload onto a pdf splitter website. So I wrote a simple code for the same.
